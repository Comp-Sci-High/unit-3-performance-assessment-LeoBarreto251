# Unit 3: Performance Assessment

Why did you pick this API topic?
Because I know Mexican culture and makes the project more easier.


Describe your API and the available data endpoints
What my API does is sends information about mexican food and holidays. Avaliable endpoints are /docs /foods and /holidays .Where /docs tells the user how to use the API, /foods sends a list of foods that is known in Mexico, /holidays sends a list of holidays celebrated in Mexico. I added dynamic pathways so that the user can type in /foods/id where id is the index value in order to get a specific object and sends data in complete sentences instead of an object.



How was your experience building your own API server after using other APIs as a client in Unit 2?

Building my own simple API was a cool experience after using APIs as a client. Since I've now experinced boths sides of APIs as a builder and a client.
